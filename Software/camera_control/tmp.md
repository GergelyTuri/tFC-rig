# Camera control files

## Overview
Recording facial features of the mice during the sessions can provide further information on the behvaior. To this end, we use network-based cameras from White Matter Inc. This folder contains files for controlling and testing the cameras. Camera recording with the Arduino based rig control is implemented in the `py_arduino_serial_camera.py` script in the `Serial_read` folder.

To operate the White Matter cameras, additional software is needed which can be found on their [website](https://white-matter.com/products/e3vision/) along with the documentation.
