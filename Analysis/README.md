# Trace Fear Conditioning Analysis Pipeline

This `Analysis` folder contains code supporting the cleanup and analysis of data generated by the trace fear conditioning rig.

## Source Code

Analysis pipeline source code exists at `Analysis/tfcrig` and in a Google Colaboratory notebook the `Analysis` directory is added to the system path so that pipeline code is imported in this way:

```python
from tfcrig.path.to.module import SomethingUseful
```
